Greetings! I'm **Kalyan Jyoti Borah**, a budding professional hailing from the picturesque state of Assam, India. As a recent graduate and aspiring developer, I'm excited to share my journey, experiences, and ambitions through this portfolio.
My educational voyage has been guided by a thirst for knowledge, with a Higher Secondary education at S.P.P College and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application from Sibsagar Commerce College, where I maintained a CGPA of 7.2 and achieved a 72% score. These academic pursuits have laid the foundation for my proficiency in a diverse set of skills, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to advanced technologies like React, Redux, and NodeJS.

During a compelling internship at **Nullclass**, I delved into the world of modern technologies, contributing to a project that involved creating a Stack Overflow clone. This hands-on experience allowed me to master state-of-the-art tools such as `React`, `ExpressJS`, and `MongoDB`, while also honing skills in efficient state management, secure user authentication, and optimizing **_NoSQL_** databases. Mentoring fellow interns further fortified my commitment to collaborative growth within the tech community.

With personal projects like a real-time chat application and a social media web application under my belt, I've not only demonstrated practical proficiency but also showcased my passion for crafting seamless user experiences. Additionally, my journey in open-source contribution, particularly translating React documentation into Hindi, reflects my dedication to enhancing accessibility and inclusivity within the developer community.

My drive to learn and evolve extends beyond programming languages and frameworks. Proficient in `Golang`, `Python`, and `C++`, I bring a versatile skill set to the table. Backed by knowledge of backend development tools like `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `Django`, and complemented by database expertise in MySQL and Firebase, I am well-equipped to tackle complex challenges.
This portfolio serves as a testament to my journey so farâ€”a journey characterized by curiosity, hands-on learning, and a commitment to growth. As I aspire to make meaningful contributions in the tech world, I invite you to explore my projects, skills, and achievements. Let's connect and collaborate to bring innovative ideas to life. Thank you for being a part of my journey.
